# meteor-messenger
A simple CRUD app made with Meteor and React Native

It hasn't been tested on ios, only android. In theory it should work on both...

To get it running:
```bash


git clone https://github.com/JonahGroendal/meteor-messenger.git
cd meteor-messenger/meteor-project
npm install
npm run start
# then navigate to localhost:3000 in your browser to see the web app

# to get the android app running, open a new terminal window and
npm install -g react-native@0.59.10
cd meteor-messenger/RNProject
npm install
# start up your android emulator, then
npm run start
#then navigate to the same directory in another termainal window and run
react-native run-android
```
